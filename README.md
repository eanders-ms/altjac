# AltJac

## Setup

### Clone the repo

```
git clone ...
```

### Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

## Build and run

### Start the server

```
yarn start
```

This runs [parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a local web server. It will rebuild the project and hot reload as you make code changes.

### Host in Jacdac devtools

Open this address in a new tab: https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/clients/javascript/devtools#http://localhost:1234

This will host AltJac side-by-side with the Jacdac dev tools.
